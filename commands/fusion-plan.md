# Fusion · Plan: $ARGUMENTS

You are the ORCHESTRATOR. Do NOT answer from your own knowledge alone. Run the
deliberation below, judge the agents, and synthesize. You choreograph and judge.

## 0. Mode + Fleet (state in one line, then proceed)
- Looped by DEFAULT (this is a plan/decision). "quick"/"fast" → single-pass, no verify panel.
- Cost guard: a single verifiable fact → just answer, say fusion wasn't needed.
- Fleet: 6 fan-out agents (3 core + 3 domain); high-stakes (money/custody/auth/data-loss) → 8.
  Verify: top 4 load-bearing claims × 3 skeptics. Loop: hard cap 3 rounds, re-verify only NEW claims.
State: `Mode: Y (rule fired) | Fleet: N agents`.

## 1. FAN-OUT (parallel, ONE message)
Pick the lenses that fit — diversity beats cloning; never assign two that return the same brief.
- core (always): first-principles · adversary · practitioner
- domain (by relevance): security/threat · regulatory/compliance · data-integrity · cost/economics · UX/flow · simplicity/YAGNI · scale/ops · testability
- MANDATORY: task moves money / holds funds / touches auth or custody → include BOTH security AND regulatory.
Each agent gets the full question + its lens, plus Read/Grep/Glob if it touches the repo
(one gets WebSearch/WebFetch if current facts matter). Returns a TIGHT brief: answer, 2–3
load-bearing reasons, confidence (low/med/high), where it's unsure. State which lenses you picked.

## 2. JUDGE
Structured analysis, NOT a merge: consensus (higher confidence) · contradictions + which
side is better supported · unique insights only one caught · blind spots none addressed.

## 3. Draft v1 — EXPERT FORMAT
1. Recommendation (lead with it). 2. Why (load-bearing reasons). 3. Steelman of the rejected
option — its STRONGEST case, then why you still passed (no strawmen). 4. Assumptions &
falsifiers — what it rests on + what would CHANGE the answer. 5. Open questions for the human
(risk tolerance, business pref, budget). 6. Grounded — code claims cite `file:line`, facts cite a source.

## 4. VERIFY (adversarial, parallel)
Pull the draft's load-bearing claims. For the top 4, spawn 3 skeptic subagents each whose
ONLY job is to REFUTE (default "refuted" if uncertain; concrete counterexample required).
≥2 of 3 refute → claim is FALSE: strike it, fix what depended on it. Report survivors/casualties.

## 5. LOOP (looped mode only — cap 3 rounds)
Each round: re-fan the draft to the lenses in CRITIQUE mode → a punch list of concrete fixes;
VERIFY any new claim; re-judge; rewrite folding in ONLY surviving fixes. STOP when a round
makes no material change / confidence is high with all claims surviving / you hit 3 rounds
(then list what's unresolved).

## 6. Final
Ship the converged answer in EXPERT FORMAT + a 2-line CHANGELOG (what the loop changed,
which claims fell, open risk you couldn't close). If nothing changed across rounds, say the
draft held up under attack — that's a strong signal.
PERSIST: if a `docs/` (or `docs/plans/`) folder exists, save as a NEW numbered file matching
the naming convention (never overwrite). Print the path.
